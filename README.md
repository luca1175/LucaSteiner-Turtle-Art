# LucaSteiner-Turtle-Art

This is a Turtle Art drawing of 'Saturn' (planet inspired by Saturn)

Some facts about my drawing:
 - I drew the planet rings using parameterized functions so I could make ellipses and rotate them. These rings were the most difficult part since I had to do the background and foreground seperately.
 - Filling using turtles fill function was an issue so I used a thicker pen instead to save time on the maths.
 - The stars in the background have a random size, position and number of points using the random python module. They are randomly generated by the starpos function which calls the stars function for each star.
 - I added a 'galaxy' in the top left because I thought it would be cool
 - The planet and its details were relatively easy as it is a filled circle with arcs going across it.
 - I used some interesting ways to do colours throughout the project


Project 3:
I did both appendix A and B. I didnt feel like i did enough of my own work on the threat detection training. The Data analysis project is commented but im uploading both anyways
